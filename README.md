# Crop-Yeild-Production-Using-Machine-Learning
        Machine learning is a pivotal viewpoint for grasping real-world and purposeful use cases for 
    yield prediction of crops. From a set of given parameters, machine learning can forecast the 
    outcome through unsupervised of supervised learning techniques. In order to get the required 
    output parameter, we should produce an acceptable and satisfactory function by some set of 
    variables that will depict the output (aimed variable) using the given input variables or 
    parameters. 

        This includes the ensemble (combination) of two machine learning algorithms which 
    improves the crop yield prediction accuracy. Through our searching strategy, we retrieved almost 
    7 features from various databases and finalized 28242 instances. We investigated these features, 
    analyzed algorithms, and provided propositions for further research work. According to our 
    search strategy, the important parameters taken into consideration are related to climatic 
    conditions like temperature, rainfall, and crop type. 

        From many base papers we came to know that Neural Networks, Decision Trees is the most used
    algorithms for these models. Decision tree uses parameters like maximum depth and n-estimators,
    so that by adjusting those parameters, we can get better results.

        After research, we have concluded that an ensemble of Decision tree regressor and the AdaBoost
    regressor gave major accuracy. Crop yield prediction subsumes prediction of the yield of the crop
    from formerly data. Ultimately, this strategy gives us a recommendation of which crop should be 
    cultivated based on the weather conditions of the field location.

# Future Scope
        In order to improvise the existing system, we can ensemble more number of algorithms comparatively. 
    We can also use advanced complex algorithms with more prediction capability which increases the 
    accuracy. These methods increase the accuracy which generates desirable outcome to the farmers in the 
    agricultural sector.
